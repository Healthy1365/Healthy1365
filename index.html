          <p class="bold">Are you fed up with your extra weight? Are you willing to try something for just 2 weeks to fix it? That's just 14 days to a thinner more confident you!  
          </p>
          
          <p>I'm so excited to finally be able to share my 2 favorite products! Losing weight is a struggle. You count calories, exercise, and watch what you eat. You try different weight loss programs and inevitably end up where you started. Many times this is due to our circumstances, busy life, we are overworked, have no energy and many more reasons. It feels like the only people that can stay fit are the ones who spend most of their time in the gym. Let's be real, we don't have time or energy for that. That can lead to a lot of frustration, anger, self-doubt, and depression. Instead of giving into those feelings, We have 2 great solutions for you. They don't require a lot of extra time for you to be successful. That is why both of these products are so amazing! Both of these products have a 100% money-back guarantee! And currently, have some ridiculously amazing deals. You definitely get what you pay for. I'm convinced that either of these products will work for you too! Most women are losing 7-14lbs in their first 2 weeks!* Remember the journey always begins with one step.</p>

        <p>Customer review for the red tea detox; 
          <br>
          Firstly, it tastes incredible, and I felt full of energy immediately. Not that caffeinated, artificial energy that coffee gives you and you crash an hour later. This had me completely full of beans all day! And this is with no sugar, no artificial nasties. And secondly... the weight really does come off! Within a few days I felt lighter around the hips and waist, and by the end of the first week, I managed to squeeze into a pair of size 12 jeans that I hadn’t worn in ages! A week later and I’m down to size 10, and couldn’t be happier. I actually wore a little black dress on the weekend that my husband hadn’t seen me in for years and needless to say, he couldn’t keep his hands off me. I feel the youngest I’ve felt in years, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. The best part is, I know exactly what I’m putting into my body, because the recipe is all easy-to-find organic ingredients. I was able to start right away, and I can continue or discontinue whenever I want. No hidden subscriptions, no waiting for the mail. Thank you so much Liz! - Wendy McClintock, Portland, Oregon </p>

        <p>You can do it! You can be successful! When you put your mind to it anything is possible. We often don't give ourselves enough credit for had we have accomplished or what we can accomplish. I believe that no matter what your past experiences have been, you can do it! I've given up in the past on many things and it made me into an unsatisfied and unhappy person. I have seen that when you achieve the small successes it allows you to become more confident. Confidence is a key ingredient to success, it may lead to a better job, a raise, promotion, admiration and respect from others, and many more things. It's not always easy but if you stick to it you'll see the success and feel that confidence. I can tell you that I enjoy my new found confidence.</p>
