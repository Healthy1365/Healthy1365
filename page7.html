        <p>You can do it! You can be successful! When you put your mind to it anything is possible. We often don't give ourselves enough credit for had we have accomplished or what we can accomplish. I believe that no matter what your past experiences have been, you can do it! I've given up in the past on many things and it made me into an unsatisfied and unhappy person. I have seen that when you achieve the small successes it allows you to become more confident. Confidence is a key ingredient to success, it may lead to a better job, a raise, promotion, admiration and respect from others, and many more things. It's not always easy but if you stick to it you'll see the success and feel that confidence that you deserve.</p>
